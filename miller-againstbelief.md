## Against Belief, or, the Liturgies of the Classroom

What are compositionists to do with religion? In their introduction to [a *Present Tense* bibliography on religion and composition](http://www.presenttensejournal.org/volume-6/twenty-five-years-of-faith-in-writing-religion-and-composition-1992-2017/), Paul Lynch and Matt Miller note that "the story of the problematic religious student is told again and again." Composition scholarship often depicts composition instructors committed to critical thinking and free inquiry at odds with religious students whose commitments to drawing on their faith in academic writing clash with academic norms. This encounter recurs in the literature from early narratives by Chris Anderson and Douglas Downs to Heather Thomson-Bunn's recent analytical work, which interviews composition instructors to reveal what Lynch and Miller call "familiar perceptions: the students don’t distinguish between faith and facts; they write only to like-minded audiences; they cite the Bible uncritically; they are intolerant toward those who do not share their attitudes." Lynch and Miller find the frequency of these conflicts decreasing over the past twenty-five years as composition instructors have found new ways to negotiate and understand religious discourses in the classroom, whether through pragmatism (DePalma, 2011), monster theory (Vander Lei, 2015) or casuistic stretching (Ringer, "Consequences" 2013). Yet Thomson-Bunn's 2017 study demonstrates that a sense of conflict persists between composition instructors and certain of their religious students. 

Though scholars like Michael-John DePalma, Elizabeth Vander Lei, and Jeffrey M. Ringer have proposed invaluable means of improving relations between composition instructors and their problematic religious students, the field has yet to fully investigate the root causes of this conflict. DePalma identifies "disciplinary biases" as a challenge to taking religious seriously in the classroom (220), and Ringer observes how the pluralism of a secular university may threaten a religious student's belief in absolute truth ("Consequences," 275). These are certainly reasons that an encounter between a composition instructor and a religious student might be fraught, yet neither DePalma nor Ringer investigates them extensively. Moreover, it is not clear to me that either of these causes quite accounts for the intensity of emotion evinced by the literature on this subject. Patricia Bizzell’s “Faith-Based Worldviews as a Challenge to the Believing Game,” highlights this emotion in a discussion of Peter Elbow's "believing game." Reflecting on the reaction an instructor might have to a tasteless or offensive student essay, she writes:

> The academic can play the believing game up to a point. . . . But what if he is asked to inhabit a position that arouses emotion in him? This is disturbing, by the very fact that emotion of any kind is being aroused–emotion is taboo [in academic modes of thought]–but even more so if the emotion is repugnance or fear. (Bizzell 29)

Bizzell argues that the strong emotion religious arguments can prompt in academics highlights a need to better theorize emotion in academic discourse and its effects upon encounters between composition instructors and religious students. If a student’s religious belief is merely a matter of “students’ rights to their own language,” as Bizzell claims (34), or if we can accommodate such beliefs through pragmatism, as DePalma argues, we ought not to find a given student’s desire to think with and within a particular religious tradition especially troubling. Yet emotions like Bizzell's "repugnance or fear" continue to haunt compositionists' responses to religious students. Even in an essay as sympathetic to these students as Ringer's "The Consequences of Integrating Faith into Academic Writing," these emotions surface. Recounting the conclusion to his interviews with evangelical student Austin, Ringer confesses: "I'm bothered by the simplicity of Austin's interpretation. I'm bothered that he doesn't seem to be confronting the dilemma he bumped up against in his writing, that his Christian perspective might be one among many. . . . In short, I'm bothered that Austin saw his faith as influencing his education but not the opposite" (291-92). If Bizzell's analysis of emotion as taboo in academic discourse is correct, Ringer's honesty about his emotion is admirable. Yet it shows that however far the field has come, the problematic religious student continues to provoke strong feeling. 

In order to reckon with that emotion as productively as possible, we need clarity about its sources. Emotion in composition has been better theorized since Bizzell complained about lack of reflection on the topic (see Rivers, 2011; Winans, 2012; Kurtyka, 2017) including specific work on instructors' emotions in assessment (Caswell, 2014). Yet investigation into the causes of the specific emotion described by Bizzell and Ringer—emotion provoked by religious students or their arguments—has yet to occur. It would seem that the field has taken it for granted *that* interacting with religious students may provoke strong emotion in instructors without fully examining *why.*

This oversight may be traced to our framework for engaging with religion, which centers on belief rather than practice. Bizzell identifies "faith-based worldviews" as the challenging aspect of engaging with religious students, while Ringer's work centers on concepts of "faith" and "dogma" (in addition to "Consequences," cited above, see his essay "Dogma of Inquiry"). Yet composition instructors confront differences of worldview (if not precisely those of faith or dogma) all the time. If religion is particularly powerful in its ability to prompt emotion, I contend that this is so not because of the power of religious worldviews or dogmas, but because composition and religion alike are concerned not just with beliefs but *liturgies*: kinaesthetic-aesthetic structures that inculcate a narrative about the world, that shape embodied ways of life as well as teaching beliefs. Composition instructors and religious students alike draw their self-understandings from these liturgical structures, and thus their conflicts arise not just from differing views, but differing—and sometimes even rival—habits, aesthetics, and ways of living. If the classroom is not merely a place of competing worldviews but competing liturgies, then a high degree of emotional involvement is not only to be expected, it is built in. 

Understanding encounters between composition instructors and religious students as concerned with clashing liturgies—not just worldviews—can help us better understand, and thus better manage, the emotions provoked in these situations. In the remainder of this essay, then, I will define my understanding of liturgy; briefly exposit four key liturgical structures that act in the composition classroom; and conclude with two implications for our understanding of religion in the classroom and a gesture toward a new liturgy of the classroom.

### Liturgy as Habit

In the broadest definition liturgy is simply acts of public service to God or gods. However, these acts of worship exist and have significance in no small part due to what they do to the worshippers. Accordingly, we can understand liturgy as a set of practices that have certain effects upon the participants. James K.A. Smith argues that “a liturgical anthropology is rooted in both a kinaesthetics and a poetics” (*Imagining the Kingdom*, 101). That is, liturgical worship employs bodily practices (kinaesthetics) to inculcate a narrative (poetics). Liturgy works upon the body to spark the imagination, creating an embodied orientation toward an imaginative vision of what a good life looks like. On Smith’s account, such kinaesthetic-aesthetic schemes are not just characteristic of religion, but of any cultural project. Going to a mall involves submitting oneself to a kinaesthetics (that is, architecture, bodily motion, light, sound, smell) aimed at fostering participation in the stores' narratives (I am the kind of person who buys X, Y, or Z). The mall is a kind of cathedral that uses embodied persuasive techniques like architecture and the moment of the body to foster desire for a certain way of life: in the cathedral, this is a life lived in accordance with the teachings of the church, whereas in the mall it is a life of consumerism.[^1] According to Smith's liturgical understanding of human action, to be a human is to be one who participates in liturgies shaping one’s desires—whether those liturgies are openly religious or not. Furthermore, identity is not largely shaped by worldview, beliefs, or ideas about the world—it is rather shaped by the liturgies, the habits and practices, that people give themselves over to.

In the classroom, then, we should worry less about the various worldviews held by students and instructors, and more about the competing liturgies they participate in. An encounter between instructor and student with divergent views on religion is not just a meeting of two different worldviews, but an encounter of people habituated by different practices and different stories. The misunderstandings and conflicts that arise thus derive not just from differing beliefs, but from two quite distinct ways of life and imaginative visions about how to live in the world. Each individual student, and each faculty member, does not just hold to certain beliefs and view of the world—each one also operates based on habits that have been inculcated by a variety of liturgies, encompassing both formal religious services and secular liturgies like Smith's example of the mall or the stadium.

The liturgical understanding of the classroom helps us answer the question I started with—why interactions with religious students may be so fraught. If the encounter is merely one of divergent worldviews, well, we think through differences of worldview all the time—interpreting different worldviews (in historical texts or sociological groups, for instance) is at the very heart of a scholar's work. It is rather the liturgical grounding of our attitudes about religion and education that make them so intense. Conversation between two persons with different religious or cultural attitudes and habits does not involve just a meeting of mere ideas, but of two ways of living and two visions of the good life. Even if neither person has any intention of proselytizing for their way, encountering a different liturgy puts our own perspective into question: Charles Taylor argues that such an encounter produces “fragilization” in our views (304). Though understanding the necessarily fraught nature of the interaction will not guarantee us a positive conclusion, we must have this more frank view to proceed appropriately.

In order to better position ourselves for encounters with "the problematic religious student," composition instructors should conduct a "liturgical audit" of their classrooms.[^2] That is, rather than focusing on the presence of differing *worldviews* in our classes, we should consider what rival liturgies might be at work, carefully assessing what we might term "the liturgical situation." We must account for liturgies we ourselves are enmeshed in as well as our students, and consider secular liturgies (e.g. Smith's example of the mall) as well as formal religious ones. Though a complete analysis of potential liturgies lies beyond the scope of this essay, we might begin with the most proximate and pervasive source of habituation in the classroom: the university itself. Colleges and universities dedicate enormous resources to developing kinaesthetics and aesthetics that habituate their students, from recruitment through graduation. Students new to campus encounter a complicated set of social rituals, both those that are highly planned (college welcome weeks, fraternity and sorority recruitment, college sports) and those that are more informal (habits of life in campus housing). They move in a physical environment shaped by a specific aesthetic (the university's colors and architectural style) and specific goals and priorities (educational, vocational, and recreational). Students and faculty live by a calendar particular to their community and may share many other ways of life, from common meals to recreational and volunteer activities. The university thus makes up a secular liturgy, characterized by profound kinaesthetic and aesthetic structures, that habituates students and faculty alike.

The university, of course, does not make up the sole influence on a classroom's liturgical situation. Students and faculty also bring to their work a variety of other liturgically formed identities, including professional identities as well as religious ones. For faculty, our visions of ourselves as teachers have also been shaped by particular kinaesthetic and aesthetic experiences, which may or may not overlap with those of the university in which we work: conferences, graduate school experiences, and so forth. Much like religious students, then, we may find ourselves working in a context that has differing liturgical priorities from our other formative experiences. 

we are like them

the liturgical audit will allow us to craft a classroom liturgy that aims at peaceful discourse

Additionally, understanding our own perspective as one which arises from cultural liturgies can empower us as teachers to proceed with greater teacherly (I almost wrote pastoral) sensitivity. Catholic liturgist Aidan Kavanagh argues that “Liturgy . . . exists to undercut and overthrow the very structures it uses” (40). By this Kavanagh means that social structures tend to become oppressive on their own, yet the Christian liturgy undercuts those oppressive tendencies with its spirit of high play and commitment to memory. This liturgical antistructuralism ought to characterize any liturgy, not just a Christian one, which seeks the social good rather than oppression or profit. We cannot trust the archbishops of the university or the market to so check their own practices—the liturgies of the iPhone aim not to undercut themselves, but rather quite the opposite—yet for the health of our own community of teachers we must maintain such liturgical antistructuralism in the habits we build into our teaching practice. Even where we believe that our methodologies lead to better learning or even to justice, we must create habits that undercut the tendency of our own practices to become oppressive.

An antistructural liturgy for the composition classroom, like other healthy liturgies, will necessarily be contextual and likely quite detailed. Characterizing such a liturgy in full thus not only lies beyond the scope of this essay, but outside its purview. However, compositionists who seek to conduct a liturgical audit of their classrooms in pursuit of a more intentional classroom liturgy might ask themselves some of the following questions:

- What phrases and terms do the instructor and students use most frequently in the classroom? Whose liturgies and visions of life do they most reflect?
- What other liturgies do the instructor and students participate in outside their life in the classroom? How do these shape their complementary or conflicting identities and desires?
- What habits of movement do teachers and students participate in while in class? How do those rituals shape the purpose of the class?
- What aesthetic factors (the appearance of the room, presence of media, etc.) shape the liturgy of the classroom? Whose goals do they serve?
- How do the liturgies of the university enter the classroom? What are their effects on the goals of the class? Are there ways teachers and students could participate in those liturgies differently in order to forge mutual understanding and a common vision, or to produce more productive disagreements?
- How do the liturgies of the market enter the classroom, whether through the micropractices of digital technologies or other means? What are the effects of those practices on the liturgy of the classroom?

Composition instructors who wish to forge a productive liturgy of the classroom must consider these and many other factors. Looking beyond beliefs and worldviews, we must begin with the insight that teachers and students alike are liturgical animals, subject to kinaesthetic-aesthetic regimes as well as ideas and values. By such habits of thought and action, we can begin to construct religion in the classroom not as an external, disruptive force, but merely another aspect of life together as a community of human persons. And only through that task of liturgically enabled understanding can we achieve a more helpful, irenic encounter between composition and faith.
