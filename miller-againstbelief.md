## Against Belief, or, the Liturgies of the Classroom

What are compositionists to do with religion? In their introduction to [a *Present Tense* bibliography on religion and composition](http://www.presenttensejournal.org/volume-6/twenty-five-years-of-faith-in-writing-religion-and-composition-1992-2017/), Paul Lynch and Matt Miller note that "the story of the problematic religious student is told again and again." Composition scholarship often depicts instructors committed to critical thinking at odds with religious students who draw on their faith in academic writing and thus clash with academic norms. This encounter recurs in the literature, from early narratives by Chris Anderson and Douglas Downs to the most recent scholarship. Lynch and Miller do find these conflicts decreasing in frequency, as composition instructors have found new ways to negotiate and understand religious discourses in the classroom, whether through pragmatism (DePalma, 2011), monster theory (Vander Lei, 2015) or casuistic stretching (Ringer, "Consequences" 2013). Yet Heather Thomson-Bunn's 2017 interviews with composition instructors still reveal what Lynch and Miller call "familiar perceptions: the students don’t distinguish between faith and facts; they write only to like-minded audiences; they cite the Bible uncritically."  A sense of conflict persists between composition instructors and certain of their religious students even to the present day. 

Though scholars like Michael-John DePalma, Elizabeth Vander Lei, and Jeffrey M. Ringer have proposed invaluable means of improving relations between composition instructors and their problematic religious students, the root causes of this conflict remain somewhat opaque. DePalma identifies "disciplinary biases" as a challenge to taking religious seriously in the classroom (220), and Ringer observes how the pluralism of a secular university may threaten a religious student's belief in absolute truth ("Consequences," 275). These are certainly reasons that an encounter between a composition instructor and a religious student might be fraught, yet they have not been fully explicated. Moreover, it is not clear to me that either of these causes quite accounts for the intensity of emotion evinced by the literature on this subject. Patricia Bizzell’s “Faith-Based Worldviews as a Challenge to the Believing Game,” highlights this emotion in a discussion of Peter Elbow's "believing game." Reflecting on the reaction an instructor might have to a tasteless or offensive student essay, she writes:

> The academic can play the believing game up to a point. . . . But what if he is asked to inhabit a position that arouses emotion in him? This is disturbing, by the very fact that emotion of any kind is being aroused–emotion is taboo [in academic modes of thought]–but even more so if the emotion is repugnance or fear. (Bizzell 29)

Bizzell argues that the strong emotion religious arguments can prompt highlights a need to better theorize emotion in academic discourse and its effects upon encounters between composition instructors and religious students. If a student’s religious belief is merely a matter of “students’ rights to their own language,” as Bizzell claims (34), or if we can accommodate such beliefs through pragmatism, as DePalma argues, we ought not to find a given student’s desire to think with and within a particular religious tradition especially troubling. Yet emotions like Bizzell's "repugnance or fear" continue to haunt compositionists' responses to religious students. Even in an essay as sympathetic to these students as Ringer's "The Consequences of Integrating Faith into Academic Writing," these emotions surface. Recounting the conclusion to his interviews with evangelical student Austin, Ringer confesses: "I'm bothered by the simplicity of Austin's interpretation. I'm bothered that he doesn't seem to be confronting the dilemma he bumped up against in his writing, that his Christian perspective might be one among many. . . . In short, I'm bothered that Austin saw his faith as influencing his education but not the opposite" (291-92). If Bizzell's analysis of emotion as taboo in academic discourse is correct, Ringer's honesty about his emotion is admirable. Yet it shows that however far the field has come, the problematic religious student continues to provoke strong feeling. 

In order to reckon with that emotion as productively as possible, we need clarity about its sources. Emotion in composition has been better theorized since Bizzell complained about lack of reflection on the topic (see Rivers, 2011; Winans, 2012; Kurtyka, 2017) including specific work on instructors' emotions in assessment (Caswell, 2014). Yet investigation into the causes of the specific emotion described by Bizzell and Ringer—emotion provoked by religious students or their arguments—has yet to occur. It would seem that the field has taken it for granted *that* interacting with religious students may provoke strong emotion in instructors without fully examining *why.*

This oversight may be traced to our framework for engaging with religion, which centers on belief rather than practice. Bizzell identifies "faith-based worldviews" as the challenging aspect of engaging with religious students, while Ringer's work centers on concepts of "faith" and "dogma" (in addition to "Consequences," cited above, see his essay "Dogma of Inquiry"). Yet composition instructors confront differences of worldview (if not precisely those of faith or dogma) all the time. If religion is particularly powerful in its ability to prompt emotion, I contend that this is so not because of the power of religious worldviews or dogmas, but because composition and religion alike are concerned not just with beliefs but *liturgies*: kinaesthetic-aesthetic structures that inculcate a narrative about the world, that shape embodied ways of life as well as teaching beliefs. Composition instructors and religious students alike draw their self-understandings from these liturgical structures, and thus their conflicts arise not just from differing views, but differing—and sometimes even rival—habits, aesthetics, and ways of living. If the classroom is not merely a place of competing worldviews but competing liturgies, then a high degree of emotional involvement is not only to be expected, it is built in. 

Understanding encounters between composition instructors and religious students as concerned with clashing liturgies—not just worldviews—can help us better understand, and thus better manage, the emotions provoked in these situations. In the remainder of this essay, then, I will define my understanding of liturgy; briefly exposit four key liturgical structures that act in the composition classroom; and conclude with two implications for our understanding of religion in the classroom and a gesture toward a new liturgy of the classroom.

### Liturgy as Habit

In the broadest definition liturgy is simply acts of public service to God or gods. However, these acts of worship exist and have significance in no small part due to what they do to the worshippers. Accordingly, we can understand liturgy as a set of practices that have certain effects upon the participants. James K.A. Smith argues that “a liturgical anthropology is rooted in both a kinaesthetics and a poetics” (*Imagining the Kingdom*, 101). That is, liturgical worship employs bodily practices (kinaesthetics) to inculcate a narrative (poetics). Liturgy works upon the body to spark the imagination, creating an embodied orientation toward an imaginative vision of what a good life looks like. On Smith’s account, such kinaesthetic-aesthetic schemes are not just characteristic of religion, but of any cultural project. Going to a mall involves submitting oneself to a kinaesthetics (that is, architecture, bodily motion, light, sound, smell) aimed at fostering participation in the stores' narratives (I am the kind of person who buys X, Y, or Z). The mall is a kind of cathedral that uses embodied persuasive techniques like architecture and the moment of the body to foster desire for a certain way of life: in the cathedral, this is a life lived in accordance with the teachings of the church, whereas in the mall it is a life of consumerism.[^1] According to Smith's liturgical understanding of human action, to be a human is to be one who participates in liturgies shaping one’s desires—whether those liturgies are openly religious or not. Furthermore, identity is not largely shaped by worldview, beliefs, or ideas about the world—it is rather shaped by the liturgies, the habits and practices, that people give themselves over to.

In the classroom, then, we should worry less about the various worldviews held by students and instructors, and more about the competing liturgies they participate in. An encounter between instructor and student with divergent views on religion is not just a meeting of two different worldviews, but an encounter of people habituated by different practices and different stories. The misunderstandings and conflicts that arise thus derive not just from differing beliefs, but from two quite distinct ways of life and imaginative visions about how to live in the world. Each individual student, and each faculty member, does not just hold to certain beliefs and view of the world—each one also operates based on habits that have been inculcated by a variety of liturgies, encompassing both formal religious services and secular liturgies like Smith's example of the mall or the stadium.

The liturgical understanding of the classroom helps us answer the question I started with—why interactions with religious students may be so fraught. If the encounter is merely one of divergent worldviews, well, we think through differences of worldview all the time—interpreting different worldviews (in historical texts or sociological groups, for instance) is at the very heart of a scholar's work. It is rather the liturgical grounding of our attitudes about religion and education that make them so intense. Conversation between two persons with different religious or cultural attitudes and habits does not involve just a meeting of mere ideas, but of two ways of living and two visions of the good life. Even if neither person has any intention of proselytizing for their way, encountering a different liturgy puts our own perspective into question: Charles Taylor argues that such an encounter produces “fragilization” in our views (304). Though understanding the necessarily fraught nature of the interaction will not guarantee us a positive conclusion, we must have this more frank view to proceed appropriately.

In order to better position ourselves for encounters with "the problematic religious student," composition instructors should conduct a "liturgical audit" of their classrooms.[^2] That is, rather than focusing on the presence of differing *worldviews* in our classes, we should consider what rival liturgies might be at work, carefully assessing what we might term "the liturgical situation." We must account for liturgies we ourselves are enmeshed in as well as our students, and consider secular liturgies (e.g. Smith's example of the mall) as well as formal religious ones. Though a complete analysis of potential liturgies lies beyond the scope of this essay, we might begin with the most proximate and pervasive source of habituation in the classroom: the university itself. Colleges and universities dedicate enormous resources to developing kinaesthetics and aesthetics that habituate their students, from recruitment through graduation. Students new to campus encounter a complicated set of social rituals, both those that are highly planned (college welcome weeks, fraternity and sorority recruitment, college sports) and those that are more informal (habits of life in campus housing). They move in a physical environment shaped by a specific aesthetic (the university's colors and architectural style) and specific goals and priorities (educational, vocational, and recreational). Students and faculty live by a calendar particular to their community and may share many other ways of life, from common meals to recreational and volunteer activities. The university thus makes up a secular liturgy, characterized by profound kinaesthetic and aesthetic structures, that habituates students and faculty alike.

The university, of course, does not make up the sole influence on a classroom's liturgical situation. Students and faculty also bring to their work a variety of other liturgically formed identities, including professional identities. For faculty, our visions of ourselves as teachers have also been shaped by particular kinaesthetic and aesthetic experiences, which may or may not overlap with those of the university in which we work: conferences, graduate school experiences, experiences of social justice advocacy, and so forth. Much like religious students, then, we may find ourselves working in a context that has differing priorities from our other formative experiences. 

A liturgical audit of the classroom, then, will reveal at least two liturgies at work in addition to any formal religious liturgies shaping students. And there are likely more: as Smith's example of the mall suggests, any number of institutions operate liturgically, including those of the marketplace in which students and teachers alike participate. Composition teachers should enter the classroom understanding that encounters with "problematic" religious students arise not out of a simple clash of worldviews (the university vs. the church), but due to a liturgically formed set of habits and ways of life. 

If we are habituated, aesthetic animals rather than simply world-viewers, then the classroom has its own liturgy as well. Rather than being a site where competing worldviews strive to be heard, we should understand the classroom as itself a site where liturgical formation takes place. As instructors, we can shape that liturgy as we choose: toward the production of conflict or peace. Catholic liturgist Aidan Kavanagh argues that “Liturgy . . . exists to undercut and overthrow the very structures it uses” (40). This claim might seem counterintuitive given the importance that the church affords to those very structures. Yet Kavanagh here references an established theme in liturgical scholarship, understanding liturgy essentially as *play*: not a productive, disciplined activity, but childlike, playful acts of music, art, prayer, and ritual.[^4] Liturgies constructed toward productive activities, like that of the mall, fail to engage that spirit of play and thus become oppressive. In the rhythms and habits of our courses, we thus should aim not at the productive strife of ideas, but liturgical play. 

An antistructural liturgy for the composition classroom will necessarily be contextual and likely quite detailed. Characterizing such a liturgy in full thus not only lies beyond the scope of this essay, but outside its purview. However, we might begin with the two elements with which I have most commonly defined liturgy here: kinaesthetics and aesthetics. A classroom engaged in liturgical play will have its own distinct liturgy---its own patterns of movement and characteristic aesthetics. For instance, a first year writing class focused on food issues might be characterized by group seating and images drawn from local foodways, while a business writing class might establish individual workstations for each student and employ electronic music. Whether or not these elements become subjects of reflection, they establish a liturgical atmosphere conducive to the ends of the course and toward a playful social structure. 

Forging a rich, responsive, and playful liturgy for the classroom itself means the class is no longer structured as a disembodied war of worldviews, but as its own playful liturgy. Such carefully chosen kinaesthetic and aesthetic elements can help reduce conflict at the start by orienting the classroom toward play rather than toward strife. And should conflict arise, they provide a common set of habits and practices to which students and teachers alike can appeal to mediate, a shared liturgy to help us negotiate those views and habits that differ. 

Looking beyond worldviews, composition instructors must begin their consideration of "the problematic religious student" with the insight that teachers and students alike are liturgical animals, subject to kinaesthetic-aesthetic regimes as well as ideas and values. Through an understanding of the classroom as liturgical space, we can not only better understand our students, but we can craft a class better oriented toward peaceful, playful habits of thought and action.
